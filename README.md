## Wireframes

![Mobile Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/QEvkU4w.png)


## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React


### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): was used to create wireframes.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - axios were used for promise-based HTTP. Justification: I used axios to send API requests from the React project to the API and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - library to decode out JSON Web token. Justification: I used JWT to prevent unauthenticated user from making extra network requests to refresh their access token. Also used to remove the timestamp from the browser when the user refreshes token expires or the user logs out.
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - Justification: I used Bootstrap React library for UI components, styling and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - Justification: I used this component to load content (posts/comments) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used for dynamic routing. Justification: I used this library to enable the navigation among views of various components and control what the user sees depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.
- [ES7 Snippets](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dsznajder/es7-react-js-snippets): this was used for keyboard shortcuts when creating jsx functions
- [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/): was used to display the events per date in the calendar page

### Tools & Programs

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to create the multi-device mock-up at the top of this README.md file
- [Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) was used for debugging of the code and checking site for responsiveness
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to store static files
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons from Font Awesome were used throughout the site
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - import of font for the website
- [CodeAnyWhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) was IDE used for writing code and to push the code to GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store project code
- Validation:
- [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html
- [Jigsaw W3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the css
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) used to validate JSX code
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) used to validate performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO of the app


## Agile design

### About

The project was planned and implemented following agile methodology principles. GitHub Projects was used to manage and document this process.

The GitHub project can be viewed here: [Project](https://github.com/users/PjHurtig/projects/7)

Following MoSCoW Priortisation principles, each User Story was assigned a tag from one of the following:

- Must Have
- Should Have
- Could Have
- Won't Have


### User Story Template

- Using Github issues first I created the template for a user story that was later used to create user stories.


### Kanban Board

 - I used a Kanban board to provide visual clarity and task tracking.


## Design

### Colours

The colours used in the design were taken from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

![Color Palette](https://i.imgur.com/HzmRV4b.png)


### Fonts

The font usesd throughout the site is [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins) from google fonts


## Project Structure

### Front-End

#### React

Utilizing React in this project 


I used React for this application

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<Asset />` - multi purpose component, used to display a range of items due to being passed props.

  - Those include a loading spinner from React Bootstrap, image with source and alt attribute or a message consisting of a paragraph.


- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to display the relevant user profile picture.

  - This component uses props which can specify the source of the image and also its size
  - This components was used in profile avatar, event owner, comment create form and comments posted

 
- `<NavBar />` - resuable component, used for easy navigation of the site.

  - This component is reusable as it will display different icons based on a users logged in status.
  - If no user is logged in a log in, sign up and contact icon will be available however if a user is currently logged in, the full range of icons will be available apart from log in.



There were various pages created and used in this application

- auth - The auth page group consisted of the following files:

  - SignInForm.js - This file handles the Login form
  - SignUpForm.js - This file handles the Sign up form

- comments - The comments page group consisted of the following files:

  - Comment.js - This file returns the comments
  - CommentEditForm.js - This file handles the comment edit form
  - CommentCreateForm.js - This file handles the create comment form


- profiles - The profiles page group consisted of the following files:

  - Profile.js - This file returns the profile section
  - ProfilePage.js - This file returns the entire Profile page
  - ProfileEditForm.js - This file handles the profile edit form
  - UsernameForm.js - This file handles the username change form
  - UserPasswordForm.js - This file handles the password change form

### Back-End API

#### Django REST Framework

The API for this Front-End application was built with the Django REST Framework. The repository with a README file for the DRF Back-End can be found [here](https://github.com/PjHurtig/project-api).

### Bugs

during the project there has been some bugs that i have sorted out, for example in the calendar when connecting to events in the backend i could not get the date/time to work with eachother. Through a lot of googling i found toISOString and that made it work as expected.
